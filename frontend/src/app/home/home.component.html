    <h1>Spring Cloud Config Server</h1>
    <p class="lead">Spring Cloud Config is Springâ€™s client/server approach for storing and serving distributed configurations across
      multiple applications and environments.

      This configuration store is ideally versioned under Mongo Repository and can be modified at application runtime.
      While it fits very well in Spring applications using all the supported configuration file formats together with constructs
      like Environment, PropertySource or @Value, it can be used in any environment running any programming language.</p>
